The R package `tseriesEntropy` implements an entropy measure of dependence based on the Bhattacharya-Hellinger-Matusita distance. 
It can be used as a (nonlinear) autocorrelation/crosscorrelation function for continuous and categorical time series. 
The package includes tests for serial dependence and nonlinearity based on it. 
Some routines have a parallel version that can be used in a multicore/cluster environment. The package makes use of S4 classes.
